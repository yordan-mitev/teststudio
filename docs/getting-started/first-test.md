## Add a Test to the Project

For your first test in this project add a new **Web** test.

1. Go to the *Project* ribbon and click on the **Add Web Test** button.

2. This automatically adds a web test in the __Project Explorer__ and the test item is in edit mode, which allows you to enter its meaningful name.

3. Other test types can be selected from the down arrow of the **Add Web Test** button.

## Start a Recording Session

Test Studio allows you to easily record the steps of an automated scenario with its click-and-record functionality. The below steps describes how to trigger a recording session and start recording the steps of your test scenario.

1. Open the newly created test with a double-click on it in the __Project Explorer__. In the opened web test, you can click the ***Record*** button in the *Tests* ribbon or press **CTRL+R** to trigger the recording session.

    ![Hit the record button](/img/getting-started/first-project/fig04.png)

2. In the *Recording* dialog type the URL you want to navigate to, select Internet Explorer (or any of the other browsers supported for recording) and press Enter or click the ***Record*** button. You can choose a URL from your recently used URLs.

    ![Choose browser](/img/getting-started/first-project/fig05.png)

    > **Note!** Selecting the recording browser will be skipped, if you have already set a preferred browser from the <a href="/general-information/test-execution/quick-execution#preferred-browser" target="_blank">Test ribbon</a>.

3. Once the selected browser navigates to the desired page, the <a href="/features/recorder/compact-recording-toolbar" target="_blank">**Compact Recording Toolbar**</a> gets attached to it. A navigate step is recorded in the *Steps* pane and you can continue recording the next actions as per the required scenario.

    > __Note!__ While recording a test, **do not start another instance of the same browser** until the recording is finished!

4. Lets navigate to the [Test Studio documentation](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/) from the Telerik page. Click on **DOCS & SUPPORT** button, click on **Test Studio** link and on the next page click on the **Documentation** link. All of those actions are added as steps in the test.

5. To exit the recording session, close the browser with the attached Recording toolbar.

## Compact Recording Toolbar

Following the above steps, you noticed that starting the recording session attached the __Test Studio Compact Recording Toolbar__ to the browser selected for test recording. Let's check what options provides the __Compact Recording Toolbar__.

![Recorder attached to the browser](/img/general-information/test-recording/overview/fig5.png)

The <a href="/features/recorder/compact-recording-toolbar" target="_blank">__Compact Recording Toolbar__</a> is a useful tool, which allows you to extend the recording experience and add specific steps in between recording actions against the application.

![Recording Toolbar](/img/getting-started/first-project/compact-recording-toolbar.png)

1. __Highlight Element__ - one of the most useful features is the <a href="/features/recorder/compact-recording-toolbar#hover-over-highlighting" target="_blank">Hover Over Highlighting and the menu</a> with Quick steps to add.
2. __Recording State__ - there is a *Pause* button in case you need to perform any actions against the application, but don't need to record these.
3. __Advanced Recording Tools__ - open the Advanced Recording Tools window to explore the DOM tree of the application and add more steps and verifications.
4. __Rotate Compact Recording Toolbar__ - change the orientation of the Compact Recording Toolbar between vertical and horizontal. You can move it anywhere in the browser/WPF application.
5. __Link to Documentation__ - follow the link to our documentation specifically for the recording process.
