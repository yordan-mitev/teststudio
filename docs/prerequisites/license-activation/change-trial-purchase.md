# Change a Trial License to a Purchased License

If you used a trial version of Test Studio, and later you purchased a license, you need to switch the activated license from **Trial** to **Purchased**.

The Test Studio activated license can be easily managed through the **Manage License** window. To access it, you can use the **Help** drop-down in the upper right corner of a Test Studio instance.

![Open Manage License window from help menu][1]

Click the **'Change License...'** button in the lower left corner to access a list of all available licenses under your account.

![Change License][2]

Select the desired purchased license and click on the __'Change License'__ button.

![Available Licenses][3]

Congratulations you are now using a licensed account!
