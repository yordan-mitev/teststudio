# Swap a Test Studio License Between Machines

The Test Studio license is associated with the machine, on which it is activated and it cannot be activated on another machine in the same time. If you have a single license and you want to use it on multiple machines, you can swap it between the different computers.

To be able to easily transfer the license between the different machines, you can refer to the below recommended approach.

1. Install Test Studio on each machine.

2. <a href="/prerequisites/license-activation/activating-your-license" target="_blank">Activate your available license</a> on one of those computers with your account and use it.

3. When you want to migrate the license to a different machine, <a href="/prerequisites/license-activation/manage-license#deactivate-license" target="_blank">deactivate it on the current machine.

4. Then, complete the activation process once again on the other computer.
