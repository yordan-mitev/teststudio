#Convert .trx to HTML#

*I'm executing <a href="https://www.telerik.com/teststudio/testing-framework" target="_blank">Progress Testing Framework-powered</a> tests with Visual Studio's MSTest runner. The results are outputted to trx result files. I would like to convert these files (which are XML-based) into HTML for easier viewing.*

##Solution##

This is doable with a custom solution. There's a number of sources on the Internet that describe how to implement this. However, we recommend that you use an CMD app that offers this functionality out of the box: **trx2html**. Download it <a href="http://trx2html.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
 
The application is very easy to use and will allow you to instantly convert your trx results to an HTML page. You can implement a scripted solution by using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file" target="_blank">batch file</a> to trigger the conversion.
