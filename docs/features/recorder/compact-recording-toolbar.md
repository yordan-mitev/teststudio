# Compact Recording Toolbar

The **Compact Recording Toolbar** is designed to maximize functionality and minimize the space on your screen. You can position it freely anywhere in the browser or WPF application, so it does not cover any elements from the application under test. In the following article you will learn more about all features of the **Compact Recording Toolbar**.

Enable/Disable Hover Over Highlighting from the **Compact Recording Toolbar**. When the mouse pauses over a highlighted element in the recording surface, you will see the elements menu with multiple options. This rich menu makes it easy to work with the recording surface and its elements. It provides quick access to relevant functions right in the page or application you are testing.
