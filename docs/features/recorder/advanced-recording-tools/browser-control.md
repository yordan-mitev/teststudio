# Browser Control

You can control the browser during an active recording session. While doing so, the compact recording toolbar remains attached to the browser and you can continue recording new actions and verifications.

1. Navigate backward and forward in the active browser.

2. Refresh the current page in your active browser. That might clear any unsaved data or selections.

3. Type a specific URL, where you want to continue recording steps, and click **Go** to navigate there.

4. You can choose from list of recently user URLs to navigate to.
