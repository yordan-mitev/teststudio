# Common Steps

Test Studio provides various useful actions, which are not directly related to the application under test - e.g. refresh the browser, maximize the browser/application window, insert an execution delay, add a comment between two steps, etc. The **Advanced Recording Tools** window allows you to easily access these common steps without the need to switch to Test Studio Step Builder. 

At any point, during an active recording session, you can select the necessary step from the list and click **Add Step** to add it. You can configure the newly added steps, for example change the execution delay time or comment, in the <a href="/features/test-maintenance/test-step-properties" target="_blank">Step Properties</a> pane in Test Studio now or when you finish all steps for the test scenario.
