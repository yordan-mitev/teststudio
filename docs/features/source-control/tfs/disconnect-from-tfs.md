# Disconnect a Project from TFS

<a href="http://www.telerik.com/teststudio" target="_blank">Test Studio</a> provides built-in integration with TFS source control. Once a test project is connected to TFS, you may need to completely disconnect it. 

The below steps describe how to do this in Test Studio Standalone version.

1.&nbsp; Open a project, which is connected to TFS in Test Studio Standalone version.

2.&nbsp; Right click on the project and select **Source Control**.

![Source Control][1]

3.&nbsp; Click **Disconnect from Source Control**.

![Disconnect][2]

Once you click it the project is disconnected from TFS.
