Click the **History** button in the **Views** ribbon. Each Performance Run is listed as a row in the grid. Click a column header to sort by that column. Each Run is also represented on the line graph below the grid.

The first column of the grid shows a chart icon. Click that icon for the Run you wish to establish as your performance baseline. Only one run can be designated as the Benchmark.

Click the **Date** field for a Run to see its Overview.

- Performance Run files have a .tsperf file extension.
- The file name consists of a string of digits and the machine name, for example:
  - 129591225988564221 MACHINE1.tsperf
- The original location is the file path set in <a href="/features/testing-types/performance-testing/gather-perfomance-data" target="_blank">Set Up > Configure</a> under section 1: Basics. 
- .tsperf files cannot be opened on their own. They simply hold the data seen in the different Performance views.
