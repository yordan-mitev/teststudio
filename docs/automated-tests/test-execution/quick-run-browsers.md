# Browser Control in Quick Execution

The **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio allows you to trigger a quick test execution. Along with that it provides quick access to some useful project settings.

## Preferred Browser

If the application under test is mainly used in one browser, or there is a requirement to test in specific browser, it would be waste of time to choose the executing browser for each test run. Therefore Test Studio allows you to set one of the supported browser as a preferred one for the current project - that way this browser will be triggered for each recording session and quick run of the test.

Under the **Preferred browser** section you can access a dropdown to set your preferred browser for this project. The list contains all installed browsers, the option to select the OS default set browser or to be asked each time when triggering a recording session or quick test execution.

## Calibrate Browsers

The browser calibration is a required set of settings, which makes the browser compatible for recording and executing automated tests with Test Studio. Therefore, the **Test Ribbon** in Test Studio provides also quick access to the built-in tool for automatic browser calibration.
