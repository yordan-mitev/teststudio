# Test Recording #

The **Test Recording** is one of the main features of Test Studio. It allows you to capture your actions automatically without writing any code. You can also add the necessary verification steps to help you automate the test scenario. 

## Start Recording ##

You can start recording your tests, by clicking the Record button. This will open a new instance of the browser or WPF application with the <a href="/features/recorder/compact-recording-toolbar" target="_blank">**Compact Recording Toolbar**</a> attached to it. When you want to stop the recording session, simply close the browser or WPF application.

1.&nbsp;  Double click the test to open it. Click the **Record** button in the **Tests** tab or press **CTRL+R**.

<table id=no-table>
	<tr>
		<td>![Test Studio][1] <br><br>**Standalone version**</td>
		<td>![VS][2] <br><br>**VS plugin**</td>
	</tr>
<table>

2.&nbsp; In the next dialog type the URL you want to navigate to, select the recording browser and press Enter or the *Record* button in that window. You can choose a URL from your recent URLs.

> **Note**
> <br>
> Selecting the recording browser will be skipped if you have already set a preferred browser from the <a href="/general-information/test-execution/quick-execution#preferred-browser" target="_blank">Test ribbon</a>.

![Choose browser][3]

If you enable **Save my choice for the future** or you have set a preferred browser from the <a href="/general-information/test-execution/quick-execution#preferred-browser" target="_blank">Test ribbon</a> the **Record** button in the Test Studio project will display the icon for the selected default browser.

3.&nbsp; Once the selected browser navigates to the desired page or the WPF application is started, the recorder gets attached to it. A navigate step is recorded in the Steps pane and you can continue recording the next actions as per the required scenario.
