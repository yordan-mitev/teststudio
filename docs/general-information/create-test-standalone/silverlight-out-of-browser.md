# Create a Silverlight Out-of-Browser Test (Standalone) 

Test Studio supports Silverlight Out-of-Browser applications and below you can read how to create a test for that type of app.

> __Important!__
><br>
><br>
> As of Test Studio release __R3 2020 SP1 (v.2020.3.1209)__ Silverlight Out-of-Browser testing in Test Studio is no longer visible in the main Test Studio user interface. If you want to continue using it, see <a href="#enable-silverlight-out-of-browser-in-test-studio-2020-r3-sp-release">here</a> how to enable it.

__Important Notes:__

* If you are testing a Silverlight In-Browser web application, we recommend treating it as a standard <a href="web-test" target="_blank">Web Test</a> with no additional configuration.

* See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd550721(v=vs.95).aspx" target="_blank">here</a> for what constitutes Out-of-Browser.

* Once a Silverlight Out-of-Browser application is configured for recording, Test Studio modifies its shortcut to point directly to the application's location on disk. This replaces the Microsoft "offline://" notation. The side effect of this is that your application will not detect that it is running in Out-of-Browser mode and code must be written in the application to work around this limitation.

* Test Studio does not support the Web Browser control in Silverlight Out-of-Browser applications.

## How to Configure a Test for Silverlight Out-Of-Browser

1. <a href="/getting-started/create-test-standalone/add-test" target="_blank">Add a Web Test</a> to your test project. 

2. Click the __Out-Of-Browser__ icon in the __Silverlight__ ribbon.

## Enable Silverlight Out-Of-Browser in Test Studio 2020 R3 SP Release

The icon to configure a test for __Silverlight-Out-Of-Browser__ application testing is __removed in Test Studio release R3 SP 2020 (v.2020.3.1209)__. You still can bring up the icon back in the product.

Open the Windows Registry Editor and navigate to key _HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Telerik\TestStudio_. Add a new string type key named _ShowSilverlightOutOfBrowser_ and set its value to _true_. Restart Test Studio and the Silverlight-Out-Of-Browser icon will appear back in the _Test Ribbon_.
